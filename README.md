1. Download the [APK](https://github.com/fikr4n/android-jawi-keyboard-example/releases/latest) to your device.
2. Install the APK, usually simply by tapping it from your download manager or file explorer.
   - Your device may warn you because you are about to install an APK directly instead of from Google Play. In this case, enable installation from _Unknown source_ just for this time, usually in **(Device) Settings** → **Security**. You can disable it later once you've installed the APK.
3. Enable your new input method and set it as the default one, usually in **(Device) Settings** → **Language & input**.
   - Your device may warn you that a keyboard can collect your private information. However, trust me, this keyboard doesn't collect any of your data nor your password, unless you install a modified version of this keyboard which may be _backdoored_, make sure you download from trusted source ([https://github.com/fikr4n/android-jawi-keyboard-example/](https://github.com/fikr4n/android-jawi-keyboard-example/)).
4. Start typing and enjoy **Melayu Keyboard**!
   - In case the switcher button at your current soft keyboard doesn't switch to the new input method, pull down the notification manager at the top of the screen and tap **Choose input method**.
